# Coursera_Google_IT_Automation_with_Python
The scripts in this repository are provided to show the modules and concepts that I worked with while solving problems in the Google IT Automation with Python course.
Periodically, data, parts of the code and comments were provided by the creators of the course.
However, writing the script and solving the problem was up to me.
